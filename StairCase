StairCase

steps=int(input())
n1,n2=0,1
if steps==0:
    print(0)
elif steps==1:
    print(1)
else:
    cnt=0
    while(cnt<steps):
        n3=n1+n2
        n1,n2=n2,n3
        cnt+=1
    print(n3)  
 
Input :
	5
Output:
	8

Program Logic:
	find number ways to reach the Nth step.
	N step reached from N-1 step or N-2 step.
	Assume N=3,
		three can be reached from 2nd step or 1 step.
	N=5, from 4th step or 3rd Step.
	pattern like Fibonacci series.
Program Detailed Explanation:
	if number of step=1 then answer is 1.
	if greater than 1 then while loop iterate step-1 time from 0.
